//when we are not sure which type of data has to be held by an array , we use Any datatype


let data: any[] = [3, 5, 'hello', true]


// it also has a disadvantage

// sometimes we know that a variable is only going to contain either string or only number or  only boolean in that case also if we use any[] instead or or | then there are more chances of getting errors.

// so we should avoid using any[] most of the times
